009. Minimize the Heights II

Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K.

For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly
once.

- Increase the height of the tower by K
- Decrease the height of the tower by K

Find out the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and
tallest towers after you have modified each tower.

You can find a slight modification of the problem here.
Note: It is compulsory to increase or decrease the height by K for each tower.
After the operation, the resultant array should not contain any negative integers.

Examples :

Input: k = 2, arr[] = {1, 5, 8, 10}
Output: 5
Explanation: The array can be modified as {1+k, 5-k, 8-k, 10-k} = {3, 3, 6, 8}.The difference between the largest and the smallest is 8-3 = 5.

Input: k = 3, arr[] = {3, 9, 12, 16, 20}
Output: 11
Explanation: The array can be modified as {3+k, 9+k, 12-k, 16-k, 20-k} -> {6, 12, 9, 13, 17}.The difference between the largest and the smallest is 17-6 = 11.

Constraints
1 ≤ k ≤ 10^7
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^7

Expected Complexities:
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
